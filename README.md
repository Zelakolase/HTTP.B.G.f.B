# HTTP.B.G.f.B
(HTTP) (B)inary (G)ames (f)or (B)eginners

## Instructions
Every executable is a mini-http server that has a logic-based vulnerability. To play,<br>
`$ sudo ./ch[num]` Where **[num]** is the challenge number, I recommend going from 0 to 3.<br>
The server should be run in 127.0.0.1.<br>
Every Binary is a shared-lib-elf.

## Goal
Collect the 4 flags, each flag is 9 numbers long, the sum of the 4 flags is `7106425675`.

## "It's hard, what should I do?"
1. Try to build a problem-solving mindset.
2. Learn Web Penetration Testing from a better resource.
3. Start with Ch0 . If you're able to solve it, you can proceed, you just need a lil push xD.<br>Otherwise, try to learn basics first.
4. Search for hints!

## Yay! I solved them all!
Congratulations! You can send me the 4 flags on my e-mail `morad.gill@gmail.com` and I'll be happy to send you weekly challenges varying in difficulty!
